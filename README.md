# WordPress Beats Playground

This repository houses a **WordPress Playground configuration** that spins up a disposable site focused on the **Beats Upload Player** plugin. The plugin is bundled directly in this project, so Playground unzips it locally, activates it, and creates a “Beats Playground” page that renders the `[beats_player_demo]` shortcode in seconds—no hosting, no local setup.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Open the link below in any modern browser.  
2. Playground provisions a brand-new WordPress instance (powered by WebAssembly).  
3. The Beats Upload Player plugin is already active, and the homepage shows the demo shortcode.

## 🔧 How the Playground Is Provisioned

The `playground-beats.json` file defines every automated step:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://playground.wordpress.net/blueprint-schema.json",
  "landingPage": "/beats-playground/",
  "preferredVersions": {
    "php": "8.2",
    "wp": "6.5"
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "step": "unzip",
      "zipFile": {
        "resource": "url",
        "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystalthedeveloper/wordpress-beats-playground/main/assets/beats-upload-player.zip"
      },
      "extractToPath": "/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/"
    },
    {
      "step": "activatePlugin",
      "pluginPath": "beats-upload-player/beats-upload-player.php"
    },
    {
      "step": "createPost",
      "title": "Beats Playground",
      "slug": "beats-playground",
      "content": "<!-- wp:shortcode -->[beats_player_demo]<!-- /wp:shortcode -->"
    },
    {
      "step": "setHomepage",
      "pageId": "{{posts.beats-playground}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Plugin bundle:** downloads `assets/beats-upload-player.zip` from this repo and unzips it into `/wp-content/plugins`.  
- **Activation:** ensures the plugin is ready the moment Playground boots and renders the shortcode immediately.  
- **Demo page:** renders the `[beats_player_demo]` shortcode inside a Block Editor shortcode block.  
- **Homepage:** the newly created “Beats Playground” page becomes the front page so the demo loads immediately.

---

## ✏️ Customize the Demo

- **Modify the page content:** edit the `content` field to include copy, headings, or additional shortcodes.  
- **Add more plugins:** drop another plugin ZIP into `assets/`, add a matching `unzip` step (pointing at the raw file), and then activate it.  
- **Chain steps:** Playground also accepts steps such as `importFile`, `setOption`, or running `wp-cli` commands. See the [official docs](https://wordpress.github.io/wordpress-playground/) for the full schema.

### Adding the Beats Visualizer (optional)

If you want the page to showcase the Beats Visualizer plugin too, bundle its ZIP (for example `assets/beats-visualizer.zip`), add another `unzip` step that extracts to `/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/`, and then add an `activatePlugin` step targeting `beats-visualizer/beats-visualizer.php` before the `createPost` block.

Then reference its shortcode inside the page content, e.g.:

```html
<!-- wp:heading --><h2>Visualizer Preview</h2><!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:shortcode -->[beats_visualizer_demo]<!-- /wp:shortcode -->
```

---

## 🧩 Shortcode Helpers

The demo expects each plugin to register its own “demo wrapper” shortcode so the preview has context. Example:

```php
add_shortcode( 'beats_player_demo', function () {
    return '<h3>Beats Upload Player Demo</h3>' . do_shortcode( '[beats_upload_player]' );
} );
```

Ship an equivalent snippet in each plugin to keep the Playground content clean.
